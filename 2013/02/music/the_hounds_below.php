            <div class='ac'><p class='col col_6 col_offset_3 last'><strong>There’s never been a doubt</strong> that Jason Stollsteimer knows how to write a hook. His time with garage rock outfit the Von Bondies served as a distinct demonstration of his ability to write a song that you couldn’t shake if you tried. Yet listening to his current band, The Hounds Below, something else becomes crystal clear: this guy can really sing.</p></div>

                    <p><strong>In the span of just 10 songs</strong> on their recent debut, <em>You Light Me Up in the Dark</em>, the mood shifts seamlessly in highs and lows, while Stollsteimer’s vocals shift just as easily between an Elvis Presley croon and Cobain-esque wailing. It’s an impressive feat that serves as a hook of its own upon first listen of the album.</p>
                    <p>But he’ll be the first to tell you that The Hounds Below isn’t a one-man show. Drummer Griffin Bastian, bassist Mathew Hofman, and guitarist Skye Thrasher hold it down with a mix of emphatic rhythms and sticky melodies. The band’s divergent influences peek out here and there, from the post-punk urgency on songs like “Since He Came to Play” and “Deathcab Song,” to the Americana-tinged riffs of the title track and “Chelsea’s Calling.” But the eclectic mix of throwbacks somehow produces something that’s very now. And, perhaps more importantly, very approachable.</p>
                    <p>“I like the purity of a good pop song,” says Stollsteimer. “I hate feeling isolated when I hear music that I don’t understand… like jazz or classical. I don’t read music, I’m not classically trained. I grew up listening to Nirvana and Pavement and Buddy Holly. I write music that’s accessible. Even if the lyrics can be deep [sometimes], people can still enjoy it. I think that’s important.”</p>

                        <p><strong>They came together</strong> through a combination of friends, word of mouth, and Facebook in January of 2012. Stollsteimer wanted to make his side project a permanent band so he put the word out. None of the members had met, or even heard each other play, before auditions. But the stars aligned and the Hounds Below became an official thing. “The chance of it working was totally random. I’m very surprised we get along at all,” says Stollsteimer.</p>
                        <p>“It’s a crapshoot,” says Hofman. “Half of your duty is to play the songs right and be a good musician. The other half is getting along with everybody.” </p>
                        <p class='nobreak'>For a band that didn’t know one another a year ago, by the listen of it, you’d never guess. “With this band, the friendships have grown through the band, not before the band. The sound wasn’t initially a group thing, but it’s become that,” says Stollsteimer. “We morphed,” adds Hofman.</p>
                        <p>“We’re a lot more comfortable than we were, say last January,” conceded Stollsteimer. “We’re still getting to know each other on a personal level. But musically, everybody’s on the same page, which I’m very surprised at.” Given the legendary band member showdowns in rock ‘n’ roll history, one can’t blame his astonishment.</p>

                    <p>Now that everyone has settled in, what does 2013 look like for The Hounds Below? They just returned from a Midwest mini tour, which included a stop in Illinois to record a Daytrotter Session. The coming months include more shows, a stint at SXSW and, if they have anything to do with it, another record. </p>
                    <p>But for now, we’ll keep spinning their excellent debut. You should too.</p>
