            <p><strong>Going from graffiti artist</strong> to gallery owners is like navigating the Lodge during rush hour—it’s full of potholes and not all that advisable. But then again Dan Armand and Jesse Cory, the owners of the wildly successful 323East Gallery in Royal Oak, have always kind of done things their own way. It started with a simple idea to create a small space where their artist friends could show off some of their latest work and has turned into one of the more acclaimed galleries in the area. </p>
            <p>Now, with more than 50 exhibitions under the belt, the pair are bucking trends again, leaving the friendly confines of their 500-sq.-ft. gallery for the city. Eastern Market to be exact. “It’s the one place downtown where people always are,” explains Armand, “People of all backgrounds, from a ton of different places.” </p>
            <p>Of course, when they started 323East five years ago, the two would never have dreamt about needing a larger space. But all that changed when storied Detroit artist Glenn Barr one of the most celebrated and successful underground artists in the city, walked into their space and told the guys he would love to display some work in the gallery. “Glenn kind of gave us some credibility,” says Armand. </p>

            <p>So much so, that three years later the guys started the search for a new space. Scouring locations throughout the city, they rummaged around Corktown, Mid-town, Downtown, and finally settled in artist-rich Eastern Market. And with the new place comes a new name: Inner State Gallery. “We kind of just wanted to start everything over,” explains Armand about the name change. </p>
            <p>At three levels and 10,000 sq. ft., new space is expansive. And while the building was renovated in 2006, Cory and Armand made sure to put their own signature on the place, knocking down some walls and reinforcing others to create a truly unique space that feels more high-end than their old gallery. “323East had a real DIY feel. The new space really makes us feel legit,” adds Armand.</p>

            <p>The building will not only accommodate the sizeable white wall gallery for all their upcoming shows, but it will also house the production offices of their ridiculously successful online gallery 1xRUN, which is thriving so much, they churn out more than 1,000 prints weekly. On the third floor is an artist-in-residency live/work space where visiting artists will be able to stay and create some of the work you’ll they’ll display at Inner State shows.“</p>

            <p>Inner State officially open on May 17th, and for the occasion, they’re welcoming back  their good friend Barr who will display his newest exhibition, “Rooms.” Inspired by a lethargic Detroit, the show will feature a collection of intimate works, large-scale paintings and a limited time offering of rare sold out prints from the  archives of Barr and 1xRUN.</p>

            <p>In the weeks ahead, the gallery will also host shows by various street artists, and more well-known names, like Ron Zarkin, who brings his electronic music inspired “Beauty and the Beats”—an entire collection that celebrates this year’s Movement Festival—to the gallery on May 24th. Also look for Austrian street artist Nychos The Weird, who will be not only displaying his work, but creating some pieces in the new artist-in-residency space.</p>
            <p>“The gallery is going to be fucking cool,” says Armand with more than just a little excitement in his voice. Five years ago most people would never have thought the two guys would be where they are right now. But Dan Armand and Jesse Cory have always kind of done things their own way. Not bad for two guys who just wanted a space where they’re friends could show their work. <strong>-RP</strong></p>
