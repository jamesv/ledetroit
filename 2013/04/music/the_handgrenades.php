                    <p><strong>And thus begins the day</strong> I spend with The HandGrenades. The quote came courtesy of singer/guitarist Nick Chevillet, and it was as good an introduction as any to four Down River boys who sing songs about heartbreak and having a good time in equal measure. “He was trying to be funny in front of some girls,” explains Andrew Pawelski, singer/bass player.</p>

                    <p>“I just threw it and—gone,” adds Chevillet. “Never saw it again. It was so windy. We looked for it everywhere.” </p>
                    <p>The HandGrenades come equipped with a youthful exuberance and a knack for not taking themselves too seriously, which is a welcomed break from indie rock self-consciousness. Their album is called The Morning After, in honor of times like this one, when they losejackets to the wind and come home with a hundred stories to tell. They’re disorderly gentlemen who crack jokes and goof around one minute, then hold open doors and watch their mouths in front of the fairer sex the next.</p>
                    <p>The group, which also includes singer/guitarist Tom Pawelski (yep, they’re brothers) and drummer Joby Kaslowski, most definitely wears its influences on its rolled-up sleeve. They're unabashed Beatles fan boys who've done their homework, singing swoon-worthy three-part harmonies that recall the Fab Four, but have a healthy edge that propels their sound into current status. </p>
                    <p>Some of that edge can be credited to Kaslowski, the most recent addition to the band, who brought with him a quicker pace. “Now we’re sort of a rock ‘n’ roll band with a punk drummer,” says Chevillet. “Once Joby joined the band the tempo changed. We look back at videos from before, and it’s like how did we play that song?”</p>

                    <p>“I don’t know how anyone watched us,” adds Andrew Pawelski. “Everything so slow and dragged on. Like, five- and six-minute songs.”</p>
                    <p>“I wouldn’t have liked us back then,” quips Tom Pawelski.</p>
                    <p>Pace is not something The HandGrenades need to be concerned with these days. A rapidly growing fan base, a Chevy Dealer commercial featuring their song “See You ‘Round,” and time currently being spent in the studio all have them on a trajectory that’s hurtling toward national recognition at warp speed. Maybe somewhere along the way they’ll end up finding that jacket. <strong>-MA</strong></p>
