                <p><strong>It’s back!</strong> About a month late, perhaps, but it’s bigger than ever this year having expanded to two weekends and two locations—Hamtramck and Ferndale—and hopefully the chance for much, much warmer weather.</p>
                <p>With this larger presence comes more bands, and you might catch yourself staring blankly at a lineup as good as this one. But never fear, dear readers. We asked some of this year’s performers to help you focus by offering <em>their</em> picks for Blowout.</p>

                <p>So Friday, Nice Hooves is playing <b>The Meatmen</b> showcase at the PNA and the bill is absolutely stacked with killer bands. So let me preface by saying I'm most excited about all of those bands but I decided to chime in on bands outside of that particular bill because why make it so easy?</p>
                <p><b>The Beggars</b>: I first saw this band in high school and it was awesome. I last saw this band a few months ago and it was still really awesome. They are awesome. They have songs like "Stop, Drop, & Rock 'n' Roll," and the singer does the splits and kinds of sweet jumps. Unlike a lot of Detroit bands that have been around for a while, these guys haven't completely transformed with all the latest indie trends like an amorphous blob of posturing aging hipsters. These dudes are rocking until they can rock no longer. Impossible to be bummed while watching this band.</p>
                <p><b>Cold Men Young</b>: These dudes were Bad Boy Entertainment for Halloween at the Crofoot! How insane is that?! They opened with Victory and I almost cried. For 20 minutes, this band took me back to my formative middle school years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='col col_4'>
                <p><b>The Fencemen</b>: We played a couple shows with these dudes last month-ish and they were great. Heavy grooves.</p>
                <p><b>Ciccarelli</b>: Ciccarelli also played one of the shows with The Fencemen and Nice Hooves at the Lager House. There was a great turnout and Dave fell through the stage at that show during our set. In conclusion, Ciccarelli was great.</p>
                <p><b>Sponge</b>: To be honest I'm just looking through the lineup on the website at this point and looking for names I recognize. I had no idea Sponge was still a band—whoa! I hear these dudes on Sirius' Lithium channel sometimes. I like that channel because they play Nirvana and Soundgarden a lot. Sometimes they just play like Limp Bizkit though and it totally blows my mind because I'm pretty sure that stuff wasn't until the 2000's. Let me check the wiki…well look here, it says they started in 1994 and the first record came out in ‘98. Guess I was wrong. Still though, they specifically say "grunge" in the channel description so I maintain my position that Limp Bizkit shouldn't be heard on Lithium. So yeah, go see Sponge.</p>
                <span class='sq'>&rdquo;</span>            
            </div>
            <div class='col col_4 last'>
                <p>There are so many talented acts playing this year, so I'll talk about two I think everyone else should see and two that I'd like to check out for myself. Everyone should try to see <b>Alexis</b> (Grand Rapids) and <b>Odd Hours</b> (Detroit/Flint). Alexis is like if the bitchy popular high school girl from any 80s movie mixed with Jareth the Goblin King playing a keytar. They're fantasy, pop, with sexy vocals and synth. Odd Hours are like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs mixed with the dumpster monster from Mulholland Drive (in a good way). They both make an effort to put on a memorable performance, which I always appreciate.</p>
                <p>I'm most excited to see <b>Flint Eastwood</b>! I hear great things, and they just *happen* to be playing right before me during our showcase with <b>Passalacqua</b> and <b>James Linck</b> at the Loving Touch. I also want to catch <b>Autumn Wolf</b>, because I missed his set at the last FlashClash show at the Magic Bag. Seems like a classy dude.</p>

                <p>There's, of course, the staples, like <b>Child Bite</b>, <b>Carjack</b>, <b>Oscillating Fan Club</b>, <b>Duende</b>, etc., but the best part of Blowout for me is running to see as many bands that I haven't yet had a chance to catch or want to see more.</p>
                <p>Honestly, my list is a bit out of control this year, so I'll pare it down to some essentials: I'm going to make it a point to catch <b>Tunde Olaniran</b> (his show is amazingly fun), <b>The Fencemen</b> (soulful and super melodic people who write songs that way), <b>Kenny Tudrick</b> (I loved The Numbers, Bulldog and basically everything else he's been up to), and <b>Cold Men Young</b> (looking forward to scoping them out for the first time).</p>

                <p>Really looking forward to watching all of the bands we are playing with that night. <b>Golden Torso</b> is always great. And it's been a while since I've seen <b>Easy Action</b>, I’m looking forward to that for sure.</p>
