The menu is simple at first glance. But look again and you’ll see that burgers come in several incarnations. Also on the list? Hot dogs, eight kinds of fries, delicious shakes and, for those looking for something healthier, a nice selection of salads. And for the poutine fans: rejoice. Mercury has it. They now serve breakfast, too."},

At last count there were 20 kinds of slider on the menu, from the classic Cheeseburger to the Fried Chicken (with panko-sage maple syrup!), along with a handful of delicious vegetarian options. The menu is rounded out with soups, salads and an outstanding variety of fries, including Venison Chili Cheese and Truffle & Herb. Ask about the daily mystery meat—it just might turn out to be the best thing you try that night."},

We recommend exploring the menu the social way: tapas. But really, you can’t go wrong here. Sangria and mojitos make the perfect companion to the savory dishes. Dessert alert: their tres leches deserves a chance, so save some room for it. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, join in on salsa dance lessons. After a mojito or two, it won’t seem so hard."},
